![Alt text](th.jpg)

## Overview and Origin

* Deel

* Deel was founded in 2019

* Deel was co-founded by MIT graduates Alex Bouaziz and Shuo Wang

* Alex Bouaziz is the CEO and co-founder of Deel. Bouaziz is an entreprenuer and technology executive with a background in building and scaling successful start-ups. His experience is product development, strategy, and operations.

* Shuo Wang is the CTO of Deel. Wang is responsible for overseeing the technical aspects of Deel's operations, including software development , infastructure, and technology strategy. 

* They started the company with the goal of revolutionizing the way businesses hire and manage remote workers around the world. Having seen the growing trend and challengers of remote work first hand, having experience working and operating in global companies, they saw an opportunity to create a platform that could simplify and streamline the complexities of hiring and managing international exmployees. Both of their  contributions have helped Deel become a leading global employment platform that simplifies international hiring and onboarding processes for remote teams. 

* Deel like many other Fintech companies began as a start-up, raising only $1.5 million in 2019 in its seed funding round led by High Alpha Capital and Y Combinator. This initial funding allowed Deel to further develop its platform and expand its team. Just a year later, in 2020, Deel raised $14 million in a Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz that saw participation from many notable investors. Deel has successfully raised signifact investments from venture capital firms and angel investors to fuel its growth and innovation in the international employment space.

## Business Activities 

* In a world economy where we have seen a major transition in the traditional ways of global employment shift towards remote work. These traditional methods of hiring and managing international employees can be complex, time-consuming, and costly for business. For example, compliance for a company that staffs remote employees or contractors from a different country can be extremely challenging. Each country has its own set of labor laws, tax regulations, and legal requirements that companies neeed to navigate. Deel provides standardized employment and contractor agreement templated that are railored to meet the legal requirements of different countries.

* Deel primarily targets **businesses** that hire remote employees, freelancers, and contractors worldwide. Its services are particularly relevant for startups, tech companies, and creative agencies managing international teams. The platform is suited for companies operating in the gig economy, remote-first organizations, and consulting firms with a global reach. Ultimately, Deel's audience comprises organizations of varying sizes and industries that need assistance in navigating the complexities of international workforce management. Some of these customers include Nike, Intercom, Shopify, and Dropbox. One of Deel's biggest competitors is **Remote**, another global payroll and compliance solution. The difference in features is operational with Deel being built mainly to hire and manage global talent, while Remote does the same thing but incorporates other features you would typically find in an HCM suite such as HR management, time-off tracking, and vacation management. Deel has a massive edge over Remote and other competitors especially in terms of customer growth because they offer their services for free for companies with under 200 employees.

* Deel employs a wide range of technologies to power its platform. On the frontend, they use languages like JavaScript along with frameworks such as React or Angular for user interface development. The backend leverages languages like Python and/otor Node.js, and frameworks like Django or Express.js, often connected to databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Cloud services from AWS, Azure, or GCP handle hosting, while containerization with Docker and orchestration via Kubernetes ensure efficient deployment. Their microservices architecture uses APIs for communication, with payment processing integrations, security measures, and monitoring tools to create a cohesive and secure platform. API's play a huge role in Deel's platform yet they expose them on their website to allow customers to build on top of their product and enable them to create exactly what they want. 

## Landscape

* Deel operates in the domain of **Global Payroll and Compliance** within the financial industry.

* Over the past 5-10 years, the landscape of global payroll and compliance has undergone significant transformation due to technological advancements, shifting work dynamics, and regulatory changes. Notably, the surge in remote work brought in by the COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the importance of solutions that can manage dispersed teams across different regions. Cloud-based platforms have risen to prominence, offering scalable and accessible tools for organizations ranging from startups to large enterprises. Automation and AI integration have streamlined processes, reducing errors and enhancing efficiency in areas like tax calculations and compliance monitoring. Data security and privacy have become paramount with the rise of cross-border data flows, accompanied by a greater emphasis on adhering to regulations such as GDPR. The mobility of employees across borders has led to a focus on managing tax implications, work permits, and legal considerations seamlessly. Platforms now prioritize localization, ensuring that payroll systems align with country-specific rules and labor laws. Integration with existing HR, finance, and ERP systems is crucial for maintaining accurate and synchronized employee data. Digital document management and blockchain technology are also making inroads, simplifying contract creation and offering enhanced security and transparency. 

* Mentioned earlier, Remote is one of Deel's main competitors but there are many other notable players in the domain of Global Payroll and Compliance. Some of these players include Gusto, Papaya Global, Oyster, and Shield GEO. Each of these companies have their own stengths, for example, if a customer values a platform that is geared towards internation expansion they may lean towards Oyster. While another customer making a decision on where to bring their business may find themselves utilizing Papaya Global if global payroll solution is at the top of their list of needed services.

## Results

* Deel has made a substantial business impact in the realm of global payroll, compliance, and remote workforce management. The company had experienced robust growth, gaining significant attention and user adoption across various industries and business sizes. Its customer base has diversified to include startups, small enterprises, and midsize companies, reflecting its adaptability to a wide range of business needs. The company's growth trajectory showcased its contribution to the scalability of operations, offering businesses the means to grow without administrative constraints. 

* Companies in the Global Payroll and Compliance domain use various metrics to measure their success. Many of these companies began as start-ups and remain private so typical metrics used to compare business such as revenue growth and enterprise value's aren't relied upon when comparing them to industry averages. A major metric for private fintech companies in all domains is their valuation in terms of company growth, health, and profitability. In 2021, Deel had a Series C funding round in which they received a valuation of $1.25 billion. Within that next year Deel had seen a near 10x multiple when they received a valuation of $12 billion. 

* Metrics that can be used to measure these companies success are their geographical coverage, their employment growth, their customer growth, and processed payments. Deel has now supported over 15,000 businesses while processing over $5.5 Billion payments which is a major hedge over competitors especially with only being incorporated for over 4 years. Deel has clocked in over 150,000 hired employees for customers using their services. Deel's services cover 150 countries which is above industry average but still shy of few competitors reach suchas Remote who services 180 countries. 

## Recommendations

* Deel should strongly consider developing a mobile application to enhance its user experience and stay competitive in the market. Offering a mobile app would provide several benefits for the company. It would empower users to manage their international payroll, compliance, and remote workforce operations conveniently on the go. With a mobile app, users can easily access critical information, review contracts, approve payments, and receive real-time notifications, fostering greater engagement and efficiency. Moreover, a mobile app would expand Deel's accessibility to a wider range of users, capturing the growing segment of professionals who rely on mobile devices for business tasks. This move would position Deel as an innovative and user-centric solution, further solidifying its market presence and customer loyalty.

* In order to create a mobile application, Deel would likely need to leverage technologies such as React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development. These frameworks allow efficient development for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. They would also require integration with Deel's existing backend APIs to ensure seamless data synchronization. Additionally, modern frontend libraries, UI/UX design tools, and mobile-specific features like push notifications would be essential for creating a user-friendly and functional mobile app experience.

* The selection of React Native or Flutter for Deel's mobile application development is apt due to their cross-platform nature, offering efficiencies in time and resources by enabling code reuse across iOS and Android platforms. These frameworks align with Deel's aim for a cost-effective and expeditious development process, with hot-reloading capabilities expediting iterative cycles. Additionally, these technologies ensure a native-like user experience, cohesive UI/UX, and access to device-specific functionalities through community-supported plugins. With the requirement for real-time updates and user engagement, the robust push notification capabilities and backend API integration further validate the appropriateness of React Native or Flutter for Deel's mobile solution.
